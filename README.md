Q&A created with the incorporation of dynamic JavaScript. 

Difficulties:
1. loops and conditional statements are difficult to generate. It's hard to keep in perspective the different events that need to happen and what is triggering which event. 
2. scope and lexical environment can be confusing- hard lessons were definetly learned during this excercise. Being cognizant of when JavaScript was executing functions and in what order. Remembering to console.log consistently throughout the process.
